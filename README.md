## Description
	Web Development Final Project. For this Project We sought out to implement Everything that we've learnt in JS through creating a wordle clone. 

# Run Project

### 1. Clone the project

## Run the Back End Before the Front End

## Back End:

    $ cd Back_End
    $ wordle-backend/Scripts/activate
    (! if you haven't installed dependencies: $ pip install -r requirements.txt)
    $ python server.py
    Note: When you add new dependencies make sure to run: $ pip freeze > requirements.txt

## Front End:

    Linux
    $ cd Front_End/wordle
    $ npm install
    $ npm start

    Windows
    > cd Front_End\wordle
    > npm install
    > npm start

    Note: When you add new dependencies make sure to add --save at the end of your command

    Note: If a valid word is "not found" when playing even though word is valid, open: 
    WebDevProject/Front_End/wordle/src/Assets and open Wordle.txt using VSCode. On the bottom-right, change "CRLF" to "LF" then save.

## TEST:

	Accounts to use to test:
		username: peter
